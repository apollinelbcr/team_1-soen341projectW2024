## About the project

The project aims to develop a car rental web application leveraging a [Micro Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/microservices) architecture. 
This web is designed to streamline the vehicle rental process for short durations, typically from a 
few hours to several weeks. It functions as an intermediary between customers seeking to rent vehicles and the car 
rental companies providing those services. The application enables users to explore a variety of vehicle models 
available for rent, complete with descriptions, photos, and detailed specifications for each vehicle. Additionally, 
it offers a range of services to both users and rental providers, enhancing the rental experience and simplifying the 
transaction process.

<!-- Installation -->
## Installation

Here's how to set up the application in your development environment

### Prerequisites for frontend

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

After you install Node.js, verify NodeJs and NPM installation by writing the following command in terminal or command prompt.

```
node -v
npm -v
```

### Running

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/apollinelbcr/team_1-soen341projectW2024.git
cd team_1-soen341projectW2024
```

2. Install the frontend dependencies
```
cd frontend
npm i
```

3. Run de frontend
```
npm run dev
```
The frontend can then be access @  http://localhost:5173


### Prerequisites for backend

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

```
$ npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```
(should be run on an admin access terminal)
[pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)
(For database configuration)

#### Server configuration
```
docker run --name rentify -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres
```
#### In pgAdmin : Add new server with the information in the docker command above & create a new database called : rentify

#### Navigate into backend folder

cd backend
npm i
```

#### Run the backend
```
npm run start:dev
```
The backend can then be access @  http://localhost:3000
